# Void Profligate
## All-Consuming Power
**_…and so it left, incomplete and unfulfilled._** </br>
**_…and so it vanished, bitter hatred carrying it beyond._** </br>
</br>
_Drunk off its own power, the Void Profligate works alongside other survivors for the sole purpose of furthering its own goals. Its unbridled hatred causes it to fight far more fiercely against the Void, and it yearns to steal the power of all entities it’s aware of._
