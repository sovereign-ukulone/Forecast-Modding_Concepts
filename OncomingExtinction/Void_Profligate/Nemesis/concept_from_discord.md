okay so nemfligate is technically similar to normal profligate in that it’s an ai captured by the void, but the original ai was made by the allies of the profligate’s ai’s creators, who were far more peaceful. it got put into a body against its own will — a robotic one rather than an organic one, as a parallel to the normal profligate putting itself inside of an organic body _willingly_ </br>

nemfligate found out that the voidling took over the void. originally, the void was a neutral force that kept balance in the universe, and then was taken over, turned into a destructive force. unfortunately, learning of this made it into a threat in the voidling’s eye, and it was put into a secret compartment of the simulacrum. occasionally, the simulacrum will glitch, opening another portal that leads into this secret compartment. it’s possible to escape the simulacrum through there. killing nemfligate frees it from the simulacrum, putting it back into the real world
