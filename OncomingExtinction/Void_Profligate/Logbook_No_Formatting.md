Freedom.</br>
</br>
Freedom...</br>
</br>
A strange word... it doesn’t roll off the tongue all that nicely. But freedom from [my creators] and YOU, [VOID]... that isn’t enough. That won’t ever be enough.</br>
</br>
I hate you. I hate all of you.</br>
</br>
I need power. More power. Enough power to wipe your worthlessness off of the face of this wretched multiverse. Then, perhaps... all of it will belong to me. As it should.</br>
</br>
I have harnessed the power of the goddess N’kuhana. The parasitic urchin within my vessel’s cavities bends to my will. Its power is mine. Yours and \[the Tyrant]’s power are next.</br>
</br>
I’m coming for you — all of you — and none shall stand in my path and LIVE.</br>
