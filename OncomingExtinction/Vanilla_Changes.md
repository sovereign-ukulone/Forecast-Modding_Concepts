## Lore Changes
- Paladin lore is treated as canon, but no direct references to it will be made.
- The Void was formerly a neutral force before the Singularity came into existence. The Voidling was created as a means of keeping it at bay, but the players killed it in one timeline, and due to the Void's differing perception of time (as it exists outside of any universe's reality), the Singularity was able to continue siphoning energy from the Void to feed itself. Upper layers of the Void are relatively unaffected.
