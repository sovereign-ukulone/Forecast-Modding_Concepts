## Lore Changes
- Paladin lore is treated as canon, but no direct references to it will be made.
- The Void was formerly a neutral force before the Singularity took over. This is probably the case in vanilla lore, but replace Singularity with Voidling. Here, the Voidling was a final line of defense against Singularity that ended up getting out of control.
