# Burial Guardianship
## Abilities
Kyanite elites randomly teleport around and have a 20% chance to proc a self-heal upon damaging an opponent. They only spawn in the Bulwarkâ€™s Grave and rarely in the Temple of the Elders.

## Design
Deep blue in color with golden yellow patterns in some areas. Halos float above their heads, however these halos are broken with triangular shapes jutting from some areas. Their bodies shimmer and occasionally & randomly become translucent.
