# Draining Hope
## Abilities
Corrosive elites make the very ground they walk on become temporarily toxic, dripping puddles of toxic bile that inflict blight, and additionally having a 30% chance to inflict blight with each attack.

## Design
A sickly combination of green, yellow, and white. Toxic bile stains random parts of their bodies and frills jut from the sides of their heads.
