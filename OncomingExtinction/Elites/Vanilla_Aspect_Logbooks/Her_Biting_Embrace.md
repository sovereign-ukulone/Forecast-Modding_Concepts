I clutched my blade, my palm hurting from sheer tension.</br>
</br>
I had led Her here in Mithrix’s absence, understanding full well the power She wielded — power that I, perhaps, could bestow upon myself. </br>
</br>
It was necessary. The amount of soul in Her body was immense.</br>
</br>
She thought that I was merely showing Her something that I had found. Unfortunately for Her, that fascination was cut off as my blade pierced Her back. Power seeped from Her body as She gasped, blood pouring from Her chest and the crescent tip.</br>
</br>
She asked me why I did this. She asked me what was wrong with me.</br>
</br>
I told Her that it was necessary. I repeated this mantra to myself, over and over.</br>
</br>
Mithrix never learned of what truly happened that day. I almost felt bad thanks to his expressed sorrow, but I never understood why I didn’t feel anything at the time.</br>
</br>
Her blessing of Life and of Ice still courses through the planet. Meanwhile, as I lay here, dying a second time at the hands of the UES, I doubt myself. I can taste my blood. </br>
</br>
The end is coming fast.</br>
</br>
Are you still out there, Mithrix? Do you still hate me for my wrongdoings?</br>
</br>
...
</br>
…because I hate myself.
