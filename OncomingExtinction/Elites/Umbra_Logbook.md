I was blinded by rage. How could something so simple fill me with such... such pain and sorrow?</br>
</br>
I heard footsteps behind myself. They were exactly like my own. Tense and afraid, I turned around, meeting eyes with what looked to be my own shadow — but it moved on its own. It knew everything about me. Everything I feared. Everything I hated. Everything I felt and believed, all at once.</br>
</br>
Tendrils of darkness flailed from its head, purple energy bursting from its unstable body.</br>
</br>
I had to take it down, but I couldn’t move, for fear that my death would be at my own hands.
