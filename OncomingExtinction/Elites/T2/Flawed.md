# Lunar Blessing

_Note: Void Reavers, Jailers, and Devastators are blacklisted from being given a lunar blessing._

## Abilities
Flawed elites are similar to Perfected elites, in that they randomly fire a series of three projectiles, but they lack a crippling debuff and Flawed status can be applied to any enemy post-loop. 

## Design
Similar to Perfected elites, however the halo is triangular rather than circular.

## Logbook
add something sad here
